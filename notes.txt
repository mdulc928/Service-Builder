The server connection problem: 
    * It looks like the python program must not be running for mysql to allow to alter the procedures
    while a client is connected. I'm thinking it's to prevent bad data retrieval and manipulation.
    * It also looks like any changes made to the database during the program execution only exists inside
    the program execution time. So, while the particular time we are running the flask server, the changes
    persist, but as soon as we press Ctrl+C, all changes are lost.

Progress though:
    * Will be able to work on add items view.
    * Left the db named wsoapp2 since we were supposed already.
