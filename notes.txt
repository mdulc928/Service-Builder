The server connection problem: 
    * It looks like the python program must not be running for mysql to allow to alter the procedures
    while a client is connected. I'm thinking it's to prevent bad data retrieval and manipulation.
    * It also looks like any changes made to the database during the program execution only exists inside
    the program execution time. So, while the particular time we are running the flask server, the changes
    persist, but as soon as we press Ctrl+C, all changes are lost.

Progress though:
    * Will be able to work on add items view.
    * Left the db named wsoapp2 since we were supposed already.

connection problem detected and fixed:
    * because we were creating two instances of the connection, I was getting an error since we're not 
    actually modifying the database, and were trying to pull from it.

Mostly working, still needing to do:
    * dropdowns
    * songleader needs to show on the new service.

11/14/2020: 
    * returning error code if same datetime.
    * finished updating songs method 1 hr
    * will need to bug check, and do some error handling - 
    * will also need to adjust the table dimensions again :D
